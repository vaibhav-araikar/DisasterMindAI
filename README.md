## 2. Problem Statement

Natural disasters can cause significant damage to human life, infrastructure, and the economy.

Some major challenges include:

1. Large volumes of historical earthquake data are difficult to analyse manually.
2. Earthquake activity varies across geographical locations and time.
3. Raw geological datasets are difficult for ordinary users to understand.
4. Historical patterns cannot guarantee future earthquake events.
5. Researchers need tools to explore different possible disaster scenarios.
6. Data processing, Machine Learning, and visualization are often performed using separate tools.

## 3. Our Proposed Solution

DisasterMind AI provides a unified platform for historical earthquake analysis and scenario exploration.

### How We Solved the Problem

1. Data Collection: Retrieved historical earthquake records using the USGS Earthquake API.
2. Data Cleaning: Removed invalid and incomplete records and prepared structured datasets.
3. Feature Engineering: Converted earthquake records into geographical grid-cell and monthly observations.
4. Machine Learning: Trained models to classify next-calendar-month M4+ earthquake occurrence in geographical grid cells.
5. Deep Learning: Explored Autoencoders and Variational Autoencoders for anomaly analysis.
6. Scenario Generation: Developed a statistical generator to produce synthetic earthquake-count scenarios.
7. Visualization: Created interactive maps, charts, dashboards, and reports.

USGS Earthquake Catalog / FDSN Event API:

[https://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

Historical earthquake data from 2000 to 2025 was used, with a target magnitude threshold of M4+.

### Dataset Summary

| Description                    | Count     |
| ------------------------------ | --------- |
| Raw earthquake records         | 357,841   |
| Cleaned records                | 357,840   |
| Geographical grid cells        | 4,352     |
| Grid-cell monthly observations | 1,318,656 |
| Negative observations          | 90.28%    |
| Positive observations          | 9.72%     |

### Processing Steps

1. Download historical earthquake records.
2. Clean invalid and incomplete records.
3. Apply the M4+ magnitude filter.
4. Process latitude and longitude.
5. Divide geographical areas into 2° × 2° grid cells.
6. Aggregate earthquake activity by month.
7. Generate spatiotemporal features.
8. Create the next-calendar-month occurrence target.
9. Split the data chronologically.

### Dataset Split

| ---------- | ----------------------------- |
| Training   | July 2000 – December 2019     |
| Validation | January 2020 – December 2022  |
| Testing    | January 2023 – September 2025 |

Chronological splitting helps evaluate performance on later periods.

## 7. Machine Learning and Deep Learning Models

### 7.1 HistGradientBoosting Classifier

Purpose: Main earthquake occurrence classification model.

It uses an ensemble of decision trees to learn nonlinear relationships in structured data.

Why selected:

- Handles nonlinear patterns.
- Works well with tabular datasets.
- Captures feature interactions.
- Achieved the best classification performance in our experiments.

It estimates whether a geographical 2° × 2° grid cell will experience at least one M4+ earthquake during the next calendar month.

Test Results:

| Metric    | Result   |
| --------- | -------- |
| ROC-AUC   | 0.898668 |
| PR-AUC    | 0.654764 |
| Precision | 0.620974 |
| Recall    | 0.585353 |
| F1-score  | 0.602638 |
| Threshold | 0.8086   |

Confusion Matrix:

|                 | Predicted Negative | Predicted Positive |
| --------------- | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| Actual Negative | 123007             | 5425               |
| Actual Positive | 6296               | 8888               |

### 7.2 Logistic Regression

Purpose: Baseline classification model.

Why selected:

- Simple and interpretable.
- Provides a baseline for comparison.
- Helps evaluate whether complex models improve performance.

Results:

| Metric   | Result   |
| -------- | -------- |
| ROC-AUC  | 0.866198 |
| PR-AUC   | 0.611981 |
| F1-score | 0.584522 |

### 7.3 Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)

Purpose: Neural-network-based classification experiment.

Why selected:

- Learns nonlinear relationships.
- Provides comparison with traditional Machine Learning models.

Results:

| Metric   | Result |
| -------- | ------ |
| ROC-AUC  | 0.8791 |
| PR-AUC   | 0.6388 |
| F1-score | 0.5923 |

### 7.4 Autoencoder

Purpose: Reconstruction-based anomaly exploration.

Working:

1. Input data enters the encoder.
2. Encoder extracts important features.
3. Features are compressed into a latent representation.
4. Decoder reconstructs the input.
5. Reconstructed output is compared with original input.
6. Reconstruction error is calculated.
7. High reconstruction error can indicate an unusual observation.

Used for descriptive anomaly analysis, not earthquake forecasting.

### 7.5 Variational Autoencoder (VAE)

Purpose: Probabilistic latent representation and anomaly exploration.

Why selected:

- Learns a probabilistic latent representation.
- Supports reconstruction-based analysis.
- Helps explore unusual data patterns.

It is not used as an operational earthquake predictor.

### 7.6 Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM)

Purpose: Experimental generative modelling.

The RBM was explored as a possible generative model, but the experiment did not produce sufficiently reliable generative results. It was not selected as the primary generator.

### 7.7 Historical Earthquake Count Generator V3

Purpose: Synthetic earthquake-count generation.

Why selected:

- Samples historical count patterns.
- Supports statistical scenario exploration.
- Provides an empirical generation approach.

V3 was selected as the primary count generator.

Limitation: It underestimates some historical means and tail behaviour. It is not a forecasting model.

### 7.8 Historical Earthquake Count Generator V4

Purpose: Experimental alternative to V3.

V4 was evaluated experimentally. V3 remained the selected primary version.

### 7.9 Scenario Generation

The scenario API combines generated counts with selected geographical grid information.

Validation results from 1,000 scenarios:

- Hierarchy violations: 0
- Negative counts: 0
- All-zero scenarios: 737

Important:

- Scenarios are synthetic, not actual future earthquakes.
- The current generator is not geographically conditioned.
- All-zero scenarios must be considered when interpreting results.
- Synthetic outputs are not calibrated future-event probabilities.

## 8. Model Evaluation and Limitations

We use:

- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score
- ROC-AUC
- PR-AUC
- Confusion Matrix

ROC-AUC alone is not sufficient because the dataset is imbalanced.

### What the model can do

- Classify next-calendar-month M4+ occurrence for a grid cell.
- Analyse historical spatiotemporal patterns.
- Support retrospective model evaluation.
- Provide analytical risk information.

### What the model cannot do

- Predict exact earthquake time.

- Sufficient storage for dependencies and model files.

## 12. Clone the Repository

Replace the URL with the actual GitHub repository URL.

```
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/DisasterMind-AI.git

cd DisasterMind-AI
```

Install frontend and backend dependencies:

```
npm run install:all
```

## 13. Environment Configuration

### MongoDB Atlas

1. Create a MongoDB Atlas account.
2. Create a cluster.
3. Create a database user.
4. Configure network access.
5. Copy the MongoDB connection URI.
6. Configure the backend environment file.

Create `server/.env`:

```
PORT=5000
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:5173
AI_ENGINE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000

MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://USERNAME:PASSWORD@YOUR-CLUSTER.mongodb.net/disastermind

JWT_SECRET=YOUR_LONG_RANDOM_SECRET
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=7d
```

Replace example values with your own credentials.

Security:

- Never upload `.env` files to GitHub.
- Never share database credentials.
- Never commit JWT secrets.
- Use strong passwords.

## 14. Python Environment Setup

Open PowerShell:

```
cd D:\DisasterMind-AI\ai-engine
```

Create the environment if it does not already exist:

```
py -3.13 -m venv .venv
```

Activate:

```
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

If PowerShell blocks activation:

```
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
```

Then activate:

```
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

Install dependencies:

```
python -m pip install --upgrade pip

python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Do not recreate an existing environment unnecessarily.

## 15. GPU and CPU Setup

### NVIDIA GPU Users

Check GPU:

```
nvidia-smi
```

Check PyTorch:

```
python -c "import torch; print('PyTorch:',torch.__version__); print('CUDA:',torch.cuda.is_available()); print('GPU:',torch.cuda.get_device_name(0) if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'CPU mode')"
```

### Users Without a GPU

A dedicated GPU is not mandatory.

Activate the AI-engine virtual environment and install CPU-compatible PyTorch:

```
cd D:\DisasterMind-AI\ai-engine

.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

python -m pip install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
```

Verify:

```
python -c "import torch; print('CUDA available:',torch.cuda.is_available()); print('CPU execution is available')"
```

To hide CUDA devices in the current PowerShell session:

```
$env:CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=""
```

CPU users can run the application without a dedicated GPU. Deep Learning operations may take longer.

GPU acceleration is optional, not mandatory.

5. Ensure MongoDB Atlas is accessible.
6. Check `MONGO_URI` in `server/.env`.
7. Never upload secrets or `.env` files.
8. Do not delete trained model files required by the AI engine.
9. Keep training and inference preprocessing consistent.
10. Use chronological evaluation for time-dependent data.
11. Do not interpret anomaly scores as earthquake probabilities.
12. Do not interpret synthetic scenarios as actual future events.
13. Do not claim exact earthquake prediction.
14. Keep Python dependencies inside the virtual environment.
15. GPU is optional; CPU execution is supported with compatible dependencies.

### Troubleshooting

Check Python interpreter:

```
python -c "import sys; print(sys.executable)"
```

It should point to:

```
D:\DisasterMind-AI\ai-engine\.venv\Scripts\python.exe
```

Check core Python imports:

```
python -c "import fastapi, uvicorn, numpy, pandas, sklearn, torch, joblib; print('Core imports successful')"
```

If the backend cannot connect to MongoDB:

- Check the `.env` file.
- Check the MongoDB URI.
- Check database credentials.
- Check Atlas network access.

If the frontend cannot connect:

- Ensure port 5000 is running.
- Ensure port 5173 is running.
- Check API URLs and browser console errors.
